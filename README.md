# Introduction
This repository is intended to help provide blueprints for Azure Policies initiatives. 
A simple and flexible API is provided, which allows custom and BuiltIn Policies to be combined into your 
own initiatives or Azure Standard initiatives to be assigned.

See `TERRAFORM.md` for all variable declarations and also the provided `examples` folder.
